    "# AI SQL\n",
    "AISQL delivers an easy-to-use composable query language that handles both text and multimodal data through familiar SQL syntax. Our high-performance batch engine processes queries faster through intelligent query optimization, while delivering lower costs than traditional AI solutions. Natively ingest structured and unstructured data into unified multimodal tables, enabling comprehensive insights through familiar SQL analytics for all your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI SQL Benefits:\n",
    "### 1) Easy-to-use SQL syntax to build AI pipelines without complex coding\n",
    "### 2) High-performance processing across all modalities (text, image, audio)\n",
    "### 3) Lower cost batch processing through optimized architecture to support faster and larger batch jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Three Major function calls\n",
    "### AI_FILTER\n",
    "    AI-powered SQL operator for semantic filtering. You can use the same syntax on a single table (for filtering) or join multiple tables together upon a semantic relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "### AI_AGG/AI_SUMMARIZE_AGG\n",
    "    Advanced functionalities provide unmatched comprehensive analysis across multiple data entries with a user prompt. This method overcomes contextual window constraints, facilitating extensive multi-record examination with no comparable solutions in the market.\n",

    "Snowflake's AI powered functions enable column level operations with LLM like traditional database operators. \n",

    "With this lab we will do the Following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parse document into text from pdf using [PARSE_DOCUMENT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/parse_document-snowflake-cortex)\n",
    "2. Extract entities using snowflake [structured output](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/complete-structured-outputs)\n",
    "3. Using Top-K join and AI Join to map entities to S&P 500 tickers ([AI_FILTER (PrPr)](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/snowflake-cortex/ai_filter-snowflake-cortex))\n",
    "4. Summarize research insights (using [AI_AGG  (PrPr)](https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/snowflake-cortex/ai_agg)) across multiple articles upon given ticker\n",
    "\n",
    "The information in this lab uses 7 PDF documents with equity research information in various forms.  Inside each of the PDFs is bulleted data, table data, as well as text data.  We will use the Parse_Document function to get this information into a table so that we can feed it into Cortex.  We then extract the entities that are mentioned in those PDF documents into a table.  Then we join them to a stock ticker using a marketplace listing of common stock ticker and company names.  We will do this join using AI_FILTER so we can match and clean up what the original Top K join gave us but with the logic of LLMs.  Then we will summarize the findings on one of the stocks using AI_AGG \n"
